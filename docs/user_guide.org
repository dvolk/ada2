* Sign-up

We offer several types of sign-ups:

|----------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| Account type         | Where to sign up                                  |
|----------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| Local                | https://ada.stfc.ac.uk/register                   |
| Google (federated)   | https://ada.stfc.ac.uk/login and click 'Google'   |
| IRIS IAM (federated) | https://ada.stfc.ac.uk/login and click 'IRIS IAM' |
|----------------------+---------------------------------------------------|

Once you sign up, you will have to pick a group.

If your group isn't listed, please don't pick anything. You will be put into a group by the administrators.

If you're interested in setting up a new group, please email
{{{fan}}}
to discuss your requirements.

Once you pick a group (or not), your account will have to be activated by the group admin. You'll receive an email when this happens.

** Notes on external providers

If you choose an external provider you will be asked to authorize the Ada site to access some of your user data (specifically, your name and email address).

When you're using an external provider we still create a local account for you.

If you then set an account password in the Settings tab, you will also be able to sign-in with the username and password.

We recommend you set a password so you can still sign-in in case there is ever a problem with the provider.

* Sign-in

How you sign in will depend on what type of account you have:

|----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Account type         | Where to sign in                                               |
|----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Local                | https://ada.stfc.ac.uk/login fill in the username and password |
| Google (federated)   | https://ada.stfc.ac.uk/login and click 'Google'                |
| IRIS IAM (federated) | https://ada.stfc.ac.uk/login and click 'IRIS IAM'              |
|----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|

** Forgotten password

If you've forgotten your password please email
{{{denis}}}
and you will be given a temporary password.

* Machines

On Ada, you can launch new virtual desktops to perform your work. We call these desktops machines. They are based on Linux and come with software pre-installed. You're also given administrator access so you can install more software.

** Creating a new machine

To launch a new machine, go to the Machines tab, and then in the list of templates, find the template you want to use and click the "Create Machine" button.

Creating a new machine usually takes between 1 and 10 minutes.

Please refresh the page to update the status of the provisioning process.

** Opening a machine

Once the machine is set up, you can click the "Open" button, or click on the thumbnail.

You will be presented with a new page that opens on the machine itself. This page has a menu that allows you to open services on the machine in new pages, for example:

- The virtual desktop itself
- The File browser, which you can use to upload, download and manage files on the machine

You may also have different services installed, such as VS Code and Jupyter Notebook.

** Renaming a machine

You can rename machines that you own. To do that click the pen button on the machine card that you want to rename, and enter a new name for it.

** Deleting a machine

To delete a machine, click the red rubbish bin icon on the machine card.

**This will delete all the data on the machine.**

** Turn off machine

On some machines you may have the option to turn the machine off. To do that click the orange power button. The machine won't be available while it is turned off.

** Turn on machine

If you have turned a machine off, you can turn it back on by clicking on the orange power button.

** Report a problem with/on machine

If you encounter a problem with the operation of the machine, either a problem in the Ada web interface or on the machine itself, please click the gray flag icon. This will take you to a new page where you can describe the issue.

Once you submit your issue, an administrator will take a look and follow up on it with you over email.

** Machine administrator access

To become an administrator on the machine, open a terminal and type

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo -s
#+END_SRC

* Data

Ada offers users the ability to copy data from various data sources into their machines. To do this please visit the Data tab.

** Copy data into machine

On the data page, select the data source you wish to copy, and the machine you want to copy it to and then submit the form.

** Monitor progress of data transfers

On top of the data page, you can see a list of data transfers that you have started. Once the transfer state is "Done" the transfer is finished and you can work on the data on your machine.

** Report problem with data

To report a problem with a data transfer (or the data itself), please click the gray flag icon. This will take you to a new page where you can describe the issue.

Once you submit your issue, an administrator will take a look and follow up on it with you over email.

* Settings

** Change user details

On the settings tab, you can change your user details, such as the interface language and your timezone.

Note that if you're using an external account provider, your name and email will be overwritten each time you log in. To change these details, change them on your account provider itself.

** Change password

You can also set or change your password.

* Common tasks

** Adding an environment to Jupyter Notebook or Lab

You can add more environments to the web Jupyter Notebook or Lab:

Please active the conda or virtual environment you want to add, and run the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
conda install ipykernel
#+END_SRC

or

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install ipykernel
#+END_SRC

then:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv
#+END_SRC

The new environment should now appear as an option to launch. You may have to reload the page before it appears.

** Change the hostname of the machine

Changing the name in the Ada web interface only changes the name in the web interface. If you would like to change the name of the machine on the machine itself, please run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname your-new-hostname
#+END_SRC

You will have to reboot for this to be reflected system-wide (for example in the browser tab)

* Feedback

Thank you for using Ada. We always appreciate hearing from users about their experience, feedback and ideas.

Please email

with your thoughts.
