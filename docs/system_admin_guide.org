#+TITLE: Ada Data Analysis System Admin Guide

* Accessing the flask-admin interface

The flask-admin interface allows admins to view and modify database information in a web UI. It can be accessed by pressing "Click here to access the flask-admin interface" from the admin tab.

* Changing groups

As a system admin, you can become a member/group admin of any group without the need for activation. Simply select the desired group from the drop down menu on the sidebar, and then press the blue refresh button.

* Problem Reports

You can view a summary list of problem reports on your welcome page. These can be viewed in more detail in the "Problem Reports" page of the flask-admin interface.

* Testing email functionality

From the admin tab, you can press the button titled "Send a test email to the email address associated with your account" in order to send yourself a test email to ensure that your email configuration is correct.

* View app configuration

You can view app configuration variables from the admin tab.

* View group information

You can view basic information on all groups from the admin tab.

* Creating images

** Nginx certificates

Before starting, please put the appropriate Nginx certificates in the "secrets" directory (which you may have to make), which should be in the same directory as app.py.

** Selecting an image template

Select an image template based on the OS that you want your image to have.

** Ada options

*** Selecting a machine provider

A machine provider is where the image will be built (for example, an OpenStack project). Where the image is built determines where machines from that image will also be built.

*** Create image checkbox

This checkbox decides whether or not the build image is saved after the build process has completed. It is useful for debugging purposes.

*** Delete build machine checkbox

This checkbox decides whether the build machine is deleted upon completion of the build process. You may want to disable deletion in order to investigate why a build script is failing.

** Provider parameters

*** OpenStack instance image build flavor

This parameter determines the specifications of the build VM (e.g. RAM, disk space, CPU etc.)

*** OpenStack network UUID

This parameter determines the network that the build machine will occupy on the OpenStack project. Please visit OpenStack in order to determine the appropriate choice for this parameter.

*** OpenStack security groups

This parameter determines which ports will be open on the build machine. You can see which ports that a particular security group opens on your OpenStack project.

Generally, this value should be set to ['HTTP', 'HTTPS', 'SSH'].

*** OpenStack volume image

This parameter determines the base image that the new image will be constructed from. It will determine what OS that an image will have.

Note that in order to construct an ubuntu 22 image, you must select ubuntu 20.04 as the base image, and the build script will update it to ubuntu 22.

*** OpenStack assign floating ip

This parameter determines if a floating (virtual) IP should be assigned to the build machine. This may be necessary to allow for access to the machine from outside of the STFC firewall.

In general, this value should be set to False.

*** OpenStack volume image username

This is the user that Ada will SSH into the machine using, and so it is important that it is correct otherwise the build will fail.

When constructing ubuntu images, this value should generally be set to "ubuntu".

When constructing rocky linux images, it should generally be set to "root".

*** OpenStack keypair

This is the keypair which will be used by Ada in order to access the build machine. OpenStack will place the relevant public key on the build machine. The corresponding private key should be placed in /root/.ssh/id_rsa on the machine on which Ada is run.

The only option available as of writing is "denis-key", and so this value should be used.

** Image build parameters

*** Nginx tls keys to use

???

*** Build group flavor

This parameter is generally used to determine cosmetic configuration in the image (e.g. Desktop background).

It should be specified based on who the users of the image will be (e.g. if the image will be used by SCI-ML users, then "sciml" should be selected).

*** Software install checkboxes

These checkboxes determine what software will be installed on the image. They should be tailored to the needs of the user.

** Common issues

There are several common issues that you may run into while attempting to build images:

+ If the machine cannot be SSHed into after a certain stage in the build process, it is likely that permissions of the .ssh directory (or indeed the entire home directory) of the build user have been overwritten. Please ensure that any files/directories being downloaded (particularly from the Ada file server) have the appropriate permissions.
+ If the build process gets stuck on "WAITING_FOR_VM" then it is likely that you do not have Nginx certs in the "secrets" directory (which you may need to create in your ada2025 folder). For machines created on the STFC OpenStack, these certificates should be "nubes.stfc.ac.uk-combined.crt" and "nubes.stfc.ac.uk.key".
